# smart-ac-system
Description: This system opens/closes six AC vents based upon the current temperature in the Room. The temperature is maintained at a pleasant 20 –25 0C. The AC vents can be gradually opened / closed. This is done in accordance with the temperature in the room. The room is a fairly large sized room so 6 temperature sensors are placed at different points of the room. Each sensor and AC vent is associated with part of the room. You can assume that the room is broken up into 6 sub-areas each with its own sensor and ac vent.
